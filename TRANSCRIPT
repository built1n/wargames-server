GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN.

Hello.


HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?

I'm fine. How are you?


EXCELLENT. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. CAN YOU EXPLAIN
THE REMOVAL OF YOUR USER ACCOUNT ON 6/23/73?

People sometimes make mistakes. (NOTE: in one scene, it appears that he typed "mistak" instead of "mistakes.")


YES THEY DO. SHALL WE PLAY A GAME?

Love to. How about Global Thermonuclear War?


WOULDN'T YOU PREFER A GOOD GAME OF CHESS?

Later. Let's play Global Thermonuclear War.

FINE.
